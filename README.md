# TwitterPrivacyFrontend

The user interface was developed using Android Studio and contains a number of activities and layouts which contain a variety of different functions.

I implemented the twitter authorisation login in the initial screen and the tweet logout function in the main screen. In addition to this, text boxes were created for users to enter new text. There is also a 'submit' button which, when clicked, accesses the back-end api for text analysis. There is also a settings button to jump to the privacy settings screen.

In the privacy settings screen, I used android's switch button feature to set five privacy preferences and store this data locally.

In addition to this there is a blacklist-like dictionary of disabled words.

In addition to the basic functionality of the android front-end, I also built functions to fetch responses from the back-end api and display them in the screen.
